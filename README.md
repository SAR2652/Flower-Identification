# Flowers-Recognition
A practice project for identifying flower type from image using Computer Vision based Python library opencv-python and a custom Convolutional Neural Network written using Keras.
I have used OpenCV to greyscale and further threshold the images. The preprocessed images are then passed to a custom convolutional neural network model for training. Currently, gaining 76% accuracy on validation data when using Google Colab.
